# Pagination JavaFX Sample Application

### Description

The Pagination Sample Application in JavaFX incorporates the use of
Java Persistence API (JPA) pagination in conjunction with the H2 database.

The application leverages the Spring Boot framework. The development process is managed through the use of Gradle.
The introduction of Flyway caters to database migrations, ensuring the consistent application of updates.
Furthermore, the application employs Instancio for the generation of dummy data.

Collectively, these components coalesce to form an application that illustrates the integration of
several tools and frameworks.
